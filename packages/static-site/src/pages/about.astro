                What exactly goes on in a typical day at the Senate or the House of Representatives?
                I had no idea, but I wanted to find out. It can be hard to trawl through the
                official websites to get the important information. I built this site to make it easy
                to get a snapshot of the day in, day out goings-on in Washington, D.C.
