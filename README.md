# What is Congress Doing Today?

[What Is Congress Doing Today?](http://whatiscongressdoing.today) is a site to show the daily activity of the House and the Senate of the U.S. Government.

## About

What exactly goes on in a typical day at the Senate or the House of Representatives? I had no idea, but I wanted to find out. Staying informed about the political process is part of being a good citizen, but it can be hard to trawl through the Senate or House official websites to get the important information. This site was built to pull that information and display it in an easy-to-read format that provides the stuff people may actually care about.

This site uses the [ProPublica Congress API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/) for its data, and is built with [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js). The site is updated hourly, and the generated files are pushed and served through GitHub Pages.

## Build Setup

If you would like to build the project yourself, follow these instructions.
